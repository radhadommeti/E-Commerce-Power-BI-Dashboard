I am excited to announce the completion of my Power BI dashboard for E-commerce sales, now available on GitHub! ðŸ“ŠðŸ’»

Throughout this project, I took a comprehensive approach, covering all essential steps from the initial introduction to addressing the problem statement. The primary focus was on creating impactful visualizations to gain valuable insights into the E-commerce sales domain.

This project offered me the opportunity to acquire valuable skills in data visualization while exploring the intricacies of E-commerce sales. I successfully imported data, connected Power BI to various sources, created a comprehensive date table, optimized data modeling techniques, and added visually appealing backgrounds to enhance the dashboard's appeal.

By incorporating key performance indicators (KPIs), this dashboard provides actionable insights to drive informed decision-making in the E-commerce sales arena. It enables the analysis of Year-to-Date (YTD) sales, Year-over-Year (YoY) growth percentages, and monthly sales trends. The dashboard further facilitates the identification of Top and Bottom 5 products for optimization, geographical insights through regional and state-wise YTD sales analysis, and a deeper understanding of category-specific performance using YTD and Prior Year-to-Date (PTYD) data.

You are invited to explore the comprehensive and insightful E-commerce sales dashboard on my GitHub account. Your feedback and insights are highly appreciated as they contribute to continuous improvement and refinement.

Join me on this data-driven journey of discovering optimized strategies and achieving success in the competitive E-commerce landscape.
